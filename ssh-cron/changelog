ssh-cron (0.90.00)

  * Commands using an ssh-key requiring a pass phrase have been successfully
    executed when scheduled. When running ssh-cron as a daemon scheduling
    continued after the user starting the daemon had logged out.

  * Be advised: to run (or compile) ssh-cron, bobcat >= 3.23.00 is required.

  * SSH-cron's development status is now BETA.
